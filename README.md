# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

For this analysis, the data was preprocessed for a Neural Network model and was also optimized

## Overview of the analysis
The knowledge of machine learning and neural networks were used to create a binary classifier that tells the customer whether they will be successful or not using alphabet soup. The dataset was quite large. It contained 34000 organizations that have been funded by alphabet soup. Moreover, the data was detailed with elaborative columns capturing the metadata of the type of organization, the funding ask amounts, etc. There were three steps performed in this analysis. Firstly, we preprocessed the data for the neural network. Than we compiled,,trained and evaluated the model. Lastly, we tried to optimize the model as much as possible
